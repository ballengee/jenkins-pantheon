== Changelog ==

= v19.4 =
* Fix: Mail authorization for delegated access would fail with the error "Could not retrieve a tenant and application specific JSON Web Key Set and thus the JWT token cannot be verified successfully". [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Fix: Embedded PowerBI reports will now try to refresh the acquired access token when the browser tab is left open. [LOGIN, INTRANET, M365 APPS]
* Fix: Encoding of parameters for embedded SharePoint Online apps (Search and Documents) have been improved. [LOGIN, INTRANET, M365 APPS]
* Fix: The Audiences custom meta box has been updated and produces valid HTML. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v19.3 =
* Fix: The delegated mail authorization feature would - under circumstances - fail to get the mail specific tenant ID and as a result an attempt to refresh the access token may fail. [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]

= v19.2 =
* Fix: The Redirect URL field for the mail authorization is no longer greyed out and can be changed by administrators. [LOGIN]

= v19.1 =
* Fix: A backward-compatibility issue with Audiences would cause a critical error when editing a page. Administrators with any of the following extensions installed must update as soon as possible: ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET.

= v19.0 =
* Change: Sending WordPress emails using Microsoft Graph can now also be configured with **delegated** permissions. Administrators are urged to review the (documentation)[https://docs.wpo365.com/article/108-sending-wordpress-emails-using-microsoft-graph] and to update their configuration. [LOGIN, MICROSOFT GRAPH MAILER]
* Feature: **Audiences** - used to target posts and pages to specific Azure AD groups - can now also be used on a post or page using a custom metabox in the sidebar. Consult the (updated documentation)[https://docs.wpo365.com/article/139-audiences] for details. [ROLES + ACCESS, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Feature: Azure Active Directory secrets can now be stored in the website's **WP-Config.php** and removed from the database. [MAIL]
* Improvement: A number of **plugin self-tests** have been improved to help administrators find loopholes in the configuration e.g. of User synchronization and the integration of various SharePoint Online services. [LOGIN]
* Fix: The plugin no longer "hijacks" a state parameter when sent in the header of any request. This prevented - amongst other things - enabling / disabling of WordPress auto-updates. [LOGIN]
* Fix: The **Employee Directory** app now shows profile information when users are searched for using SharePoint. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Fix: Version bump for all WPO365 plugins.

= v18.1 =
* Fix: If the plugin is configured to send WordPress emails using Microsoft Graph then it will now always replace the "from" email address if WordPress tries to sent emails from "wordpress@[sitename]". WordPress will propose this email address is no email is set by the plugin sending the email (e.g. Contact Form 7). This email may pass checks as a valid email address but in reality this email address most likely does not exist. The option to fix the "localhost" issue has been removed since this fix improves the behavior for all hosts (incl. localhost). [ALL]
* Improvement: Various wp-admin banners as well as some translations have been updated. Also a teaching bubble is shown on the Single Sign-on page to help admins quickly find the WPO365 documentation center at [https://docs.wpo365.com/](https://docs.wpo365.com/). [ALL]

= v18.0 =
* Change: Administrators who selected **OpenID Connect** based single sign-on, can now choose between the **Hybrid Flow** and the **Authorization Code Flow**.

* Feature: Protect and secure your **WordPress REST API** with WordPress REST cookies. [LOGIN]
* Improvement: **Azure AD B2C** custom claims sent in the ID token can now be mapped to custom WordPress user meta fields. [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: When specified in - for example - an email form the "From" address will be used to send the email from (instead of the configured "From" address and if the address specified in the form appears to be valid). This behavior is a premium feature and not enabled by default. [MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Admins can now set a different Azure AD tenant for sending WordPress emails using Microsoft Graph when the plugin is configured for **Azure AD B2C based** single sign-on. [ALL]
* Improvement: Admins can now update the priority for the get_avatar hook on the plugin's *User sync* page (default 1). [AVATAR, SYNC, INTRANET]
* Improvement: The plugin is now able to work with the more appropriate **GroupMember.Read.All** permissions instead of *Group.Read.All* and admins who configured role based access restriction are advised to update the **API permissions** for the registered application in *Azure AD*.

* Fix: It is now possible to save empty custom user profile fields when manually updating a user's profile. [CUSTOM USER FIELDS, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v17.5 =
* Change: Sending mail as HTML is no longer a premium feature. [LOGIN, MAIL]
* Change: Saving sent emails in Sent Items is no longer a premium feature. [LOGIN, MAIL, SYNC, INTRANET]

* Fix: The Azure AD based Employee Directory app will now retrieve the user's profile and cache them separately from the cache of employees as this sometimes would break the hierarchy. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]

= v17.4 =
* Improvement: You can now create a shortcode based app to embed Power BI content that supports the "App owns data" scenario and configure it to use the 2nd (app-only) AAD App registration. This is especially useful when the administrator configured Microsoft Azure AD B2C or SAML 2.0 based single sign-on and the AAD App registration for SSO cannot be used. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Fix: Several issues related to PHP 8.x - e.g. support for deep-links - have been fixed. [ALL]
* Fix: When an administrator has hidden the login button the artifacts required to initiate the WPO365 Sign in with Microsoft flow - e.g. needed for a custom login button or Dual Login - are now loading correctly. [LOGIN]

= v17.3 =
* Change: The default login button's accessibility has been improved and now uses a BUTTON element (previously a DIV) with an aria-label that corresponds to the button's caption. [LOGIN]
* Improvement: For new installations of the plugin the default value of the session duration has been updated to 0 (was 3600) and a user will not be automatically forced to re-authenticate after 1 hour. [LOGIN]
* Fix: The (basic / free version of the) **Microsoft 365 shortcode app to embed a SharePoint / OneDrive Documents Library** now correctly recognizes when it should use the new *WPO365 REST API for Microsoft Graph* instead of the older token service. [LOGIN]
* Fix: The exception level for "Serious attempt to try to bypass authentication" has been changed from ERROR to WARN since many false/positives have been reported. [LOGIN]

= v17.2 =
* Improvement: When the WPO365 plugin is used to send WordPress emails, it will now honor a reply-to email address defined "externally" e.g. when using Contact Form 7. [ALL]
* Fix: The **Microsoft 365 shortcode app for SharePoint Online Search** now properly encodes the query template / custom written query to enable the use of double quotes when defining values for a managed property e.g. *Path:"https://wpo365demo.sharepoint.com/sites/contoso/Shared Documents"*. To benefit from this you must re-create the shortcode for the app. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Fix: When using the *Dual Login* Feature the plugin no longer adds an HTML DIV element with a duplicate ID. [LOGIN+, SYNC, INTRANET]

= v17.1 =
* Change: The **Microsoft 365 shortcode app for embedding Power BI** has been thoroughly updated to work with the recently introduced *WPO365 REST API for Microsoft Graph*. Existing shortcodes will continue to work with the WordPress AJAX API but it is recommended to update those apps by creating new shortcodes using the Shortcode Generator. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Change: The **Microsoft 365 shortcode app for embedding Power BI** now supports dynamic tokens used when defining **Effective Identities** when row-level-security (RLS) is configured for the dataset. Dynamic tokes can be replaced with direct attributes of a WordPress user or alternatively user meta. Please refer to the [updated documentation](https://docs.wpo365.com/article/84-microsoft-power-bi-for-wordpress) for guidance how to use dynamic tokens. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Improvement: Newly created **Power BI shortcode apps** will cache access tokens in the browser's session storage and this cache will be emptied when the user navigates away from the page. [APPS, INTRANET]
* Fix: The license checker will not show a warning for development, test and staging environments if those web addresses can be identified as such. [ALL PREMIUM]
* Fix: Use the home URL instead of the site URL (where WordPress application files are accessible) for the base URI when connecting to the WPO365 REST API for Microsoft Graph. [ALL]
* Fix: Administrators can activate **Internet Explorer 11 compatibility** mode (at the cost of losing the integration capability with Microsoft Teams) when they go to WP Admin > WPO365 > ... > Miscellaneous and toggle the corresponding option. [ALL]

= v17.0 =
* Breaking: Additional configuration is needed for the **WPO365 REST API for Microsoft Graph** that is used by the *WPO365 | DOCUMENTS Gutenberg Block*, *WPO365 User synchronization* and the updated versions of the *M365 APPS* (included in this release) to keep your data as safe and secure as possible. On the plugin's *Integration* page in the section labelled *Microsoft 365 Apps* you must now specify whether user must be signed in (with Microsoft) when they connect to the API, which Microsoft Services endpoints are allowed, whether apps may request application-level tokens (instead of user-level tokens with delegated permissions) and whether proxy-type of requests are permitted. [ALL]
* Breaking: Because the direct use of **PHP cURL has been removed** in favor of WordPress' builtin HTTP API the cURL Proxy Address setting has been removed. Please refer to the [WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_http_proxy/) for instructions how you can use WP_PROXY_HOST and WP_PROXY_PORT if you need to configure a proxy for outgoing network connections. [ALL]
* Breaking: The [End User License Agreement](https://www.wpo365.com/end-user-license-agreement/) will be updated from 1st April 2022 and a license for a premium extension will always be linked to the domain of the WordPress instance. Therefore you may need additional licenses for development, test and staging instances if those are set up under different domains. Starting with this version premium extensions / bundles will generate a warning that a license is required if no valid license was found for that particular instance. [ALL EXTENSIONS / BUNDLES]
* Change: The Microsoft 365 shortcode apps for embedding *SharePoint Online Search*, a *SharePoint / OneDrive Online Document Library*, a *Microsoft Graph based Employee Directory* and a *Yammer Feed* have been thoroughly updated to work with the recently introduced *WPO365 REST API for Microsoft Graph*. Existing apps will continue to work with the WordPress AJAX API but it is recommended to update those apps by creating new shortcodes using the Shortcode Generators. [M365 APPS, INTRANET]
* Improvement: The **WPO365 SCIM Client for Azure AD User provisioning** now can be configured to obtain to retrieve the user's *Azure AD object ID*.
